 This project aims to understand ethical hacking techniques using python backdoor tool from scratch. The tests and procedures should only be executed on your own machines. If you're planning to execute pwned-by on someone else's machine, DO IT ETHICALLY! Ask for permission to conduct your activity with written instructions. Do not investigate someone else's files without permission. I do not promote any harm to other people. Please use it at your own risk! Author will not be responsible for any damage! This project is for study purposes only. Enjoy hacking!
  
  
  
  *** [Introduction] ***
  
 Pwned-by is an open-source Python3 project that requires two files to function: one in the client and one in the server. The client file is pre-built to connect automatically with the server file when executed. It allows the server file to simulate a mini shell that executes the commands sent to the client from the server.

 This repository has limited commands yet. However, new codes will be injected everyday as a walkthough to understand the step-by-step procedure using python and some techniques like hiding it on any file or something undetectable. This is also open for other people to change the banner to whatever you like. I request the use of the name "pwned-by" for the project to become known.
